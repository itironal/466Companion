# Fundamentals of Image Processing with Python

This is the companion e-book for “Fundamentals of Image Processing with Python”. In this e-book, you will find supporting material for the content presented in the print book. These include interactive code pieces that you can execute, and videos that facilitates your learning.

This e-book is presented as an HTML website, with videos that can be played directly in your web browser. For interactive programming content, we provide two options:

Google Colab – Use the “rocket” button in the top-right corner of each page to open the notebook in Google Colab.

Download Jupyter Notebooks – Use the download button in the top-right corner to download the notebook as a `*.ipynb' file, which can be opened with your local or remote Jupyter notebook editor.

We assume that you can program in Python and know how to execute a Jupyter notebook.
